# Lussie Orlova - Data Science and Data Analysis Studies

## About

Hello, I am Lussie! Currently I live in Berlin. I have great experience in IT and web development. I've worked as IT project manager for more than 10 years with a team of up to 15 persons. We made small websites and huge corporate intranets. It was fun! But some time ago I felt I should move on.

Math was always my passion. Later I discovered programming. But as a grownup you never had enough time. At some point I decided: now or never.

I've found that my two passions are combined in Data Science. I've taken several courses just to make sure that this is my way. It is. Now I'm studying Statistics and Data Science MicroMasters program online at MIT. I accomplished the first part on Probability with excellent results (96%) and gained a scholarship award. The next part will be Fundamentals of Statistics. It is starting soon.

## Studies in Python

- Solved problems on Rosalind: https://rosalind.info/users/Lussie/ </br>
Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving </br>
Code: available by request

- Mini-games: https://github.com/Lussie/Games </br>
I used them to practice in Python and algorithms
